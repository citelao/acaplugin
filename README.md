# ACAC Features

This plugin sets up all content for the ACAC site.

## Features

1. Adds new content types:
	- **Auditionee**
	- **Group**
	- **Song**

## Install

This plugin is dependent on [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2).
Luckily for all of us, they have made it play *very* nicely with composer.

The makefile in this repository will automatically download `composer.phar`
for you (locally, of course) and install our dependencies.

1. `make` in this directory.
2. Activate this plugin.
