Hello everyone!

The ACAC website is green!

# ACTION REQUIRED

(Dev note: this action is only necessary if groups do not have accounts)

Send me one email account for your group so I can make a website account.

# How do I use the site right now?

Send new auditionees to [acac.wustl.edu/register](https://acac.wustl.edu/register). This is a private link, so don't go around spreading it to everyone.

I will make accounts for each group so they can maintain callbacks.

# How do we choose callbacks?

1. Log in at [acac.wustl.edu/wp-admin](https://acac.wustl.edu/wp-admin) with the account I made for you group (send me an email address you want!)
2. Go to **Groups**. You should see your group.
3. Click **Edit** for that group.
4. There should be a section called **Callbacks**.
5. Add all the people you want to call back.
6. Click Update at the top right.

# How do we view callbacks?

Once auditions are closed, you will be able to view callback lists:

1. Go to **Auditionees** on the admin page
2. You should see all the auditionees.
3. You can filter (using the drop-downs at the top) by who auditioned for your group. Make sure to click the **Filter** button to update the results.

# How do we view pref cards?

Once callbacks complete, you will be able to view pref cards.

Same as callbacks.

# How do we accept members?

You can't. Only admins like the tech chair and ACAC president can do that.

# Questions?

Just reply to this message! Hopefully everything works :o

Thanks for bearing with me in this ordeal!
